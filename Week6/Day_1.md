## Day 1: System Code Swap & Peer Review

**Goal:** Ensure everyone understands the whole codebase and all contributory code is robust.

### Tasks:
- Assign each intern another’s full code section (pipeline scripts, API code, frontend, etc.) for peer review.
- Read through and test the code as if you were the original owner:
    - Try running example scripts with provided inputs.
    - Check for “works for me” errors — will it work for anyone else?
- Make detailed code review notes – mark confusing parts, hard-to-follow functions, and any missing docstrings or code comments.
- Fill in any missing documentation for your assigned part.
- List at least two suggestions or improvements for each reviewed section.
- Each intern posts a review summary in a shared doc or Slack channel.
