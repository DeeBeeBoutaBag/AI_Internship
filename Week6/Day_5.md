## Day 5: Team Presentation & Handover

**Goal:** Present final work, show off the project, and prepare for portfolio/resume use.

### Tasks:
- Prepare and run a 20-minute live demo (screen-sharing):
    - Walk through the code structure in VS Code.
    - Demo the full pipeline with a new file (show each stage working).
    - Highlight security features, error handling, and frontend briefly.
    - Q&A period for mentor/other interns.
- Introduce and describe each intern’s contribution.
- Submit all documentation via email, shared drive, or GitHub.
- Ask mentor for detailed feedback for each team member’s resume/portfolio (suggest sample lines for what to highlight from this project).
- After presentation: team retrospective—each intern writes/list at least two lessons learned and shares with group.
