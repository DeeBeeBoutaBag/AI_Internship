## Day 4: Clean-Up, Polish & Code Freeze

**Goal:** Ensure the final submission is professional, organized, and free of bloat.

### Tasks:
- Organize repo folders: move scripts, docs, static files, sample data, etc. into clearly labeled directories.
- Remove all temp/intermediate/test data files.
- Delete commented-out code, unused functions/classes, and debug print statements.
- Ensure all main modules have clear docstrings and import statements are organized.
- Confirm every internâ€™s name/role is listed in the `README.md`.
- Perform final `git status`, commit, and push to main branch. Confirm everyone can clone and run latest version without issues.
