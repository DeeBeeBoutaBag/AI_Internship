## Day 2: Project Documentation & Demo Asset Update

**Goal:** Polish and fill documentation gaps so any outside user could use and understand your project.

### Tasks:
- Update or expand:
    - `README.md`: clear setup instructions, pipeline and API usage, contributor credits.
    - Diagrams (use [draw.io](https://draw.io/) or [lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) for flowcharts of the data/process pipeline).
    - Demos: 1–2 minute screen-recorded videos showing (A) CLI workflow, (B) API usage, (C) frontend upload/validate.
    - FAQ or “troubleshooting” section based on reviewer questions.
- Check Markdown formatting and spelling throughout.
- Ask each team member (intern) to review the updated docs for clarity—log all confusion/questions for team review on Day 5.
