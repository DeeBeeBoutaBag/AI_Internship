## Day 1: Pipeline Integration – Extraction to Validation

**Main Goal:** Integrate all workflow stages into a single, robust script.

**Tasks:**
- Gather your previous scripts for:
  - Text extraction from PDF
  - TXT to JSON conversion
  - JSON schema validation
- Plan out the sequence/data flow (flowchart or list).
- Create a single Python script that:
  1. Reads PDF files from an input folder.
  2. Extracts text and saves as TXT (temporarily).
  3. Converts TXT to JSON per agreed schema.
  4. Validates JSON using the schema; logs errors.
- Write usage documentation (`README.md`) for this pipeline.
- Create 3–5 sample PDFs for testing.
- Each intern runs the pipeline on different files and documents results/errors.
